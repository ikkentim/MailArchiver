Mail Archiver
=============
Stupidly simple mail archiving tool. Drag .eml file from email client into the application, and it'll be archived. The
archived file is a PDF containing the mail body and attachments.

Currently supported attachment file types:
- PDF
- JPG
- DOCX \*

\* For converting DOCX files, a SyncFusion license is required. Set the license in Licenses.cs.
